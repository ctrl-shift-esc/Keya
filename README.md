Keya
====

This is an esoteric programming language I'm working on. This language is based on the idea behind Brainfuck. But this differs quite a lot from Brainfuck. The differences being in the waz Keya sees the memory. The memory is seen as a 20*20 grid. The commands too differ from Brainfuck. The only commands which remain the same are, `+`, `-`, `[` and `]`. In Keya you can move the Pointer in 4 directions. The data in a cell can also be copied to its neighbours in 4 directions.

Please see the documentation for complete list of commands. You can find the guide to using Keya in the `doc` folder. Examples are given in `Example` folder.
